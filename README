# Setting Up the Development Environment

To set up the development environment for this project, please follow the steps below.

## Step 1: Install Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed the necessary prerequisites by following the steps contained in the `./INSTALL GUIDE.md` file.

## Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the project's repository to your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HeroCod/DMML.git
cd DMML
```

## Step 3: Run the Setup Script

Run the `setup_env.sh` script to configure the project environment.

```sh
bash setup_env.sh
```

### What the Setup Script Does

The `setup_env.sh` script performs the following actions:

1. **Checks for the 'DMML' Conda Environment**: It checks if the `DMML` conda environment already exists on your machine.
2. **Creates the Environment If Necessary**: If the `DMML` environment does not exist, the script will create it using the `environment.yml` file located in the `.vscode` folder.
3. **Updates VSCode Settings**: It updates the VSCode `settings.json` file to point to the newly created conda environment, ensuring that your development environment is correctly configured within VSCode.

By following these steps, the project environment should be properly set up and ready for use.
